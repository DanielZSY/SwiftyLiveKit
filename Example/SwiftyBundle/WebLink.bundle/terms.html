You further understand and agree that Volum may remove certain Content from its storage systems periodically in its discretion without notice to you.

26. Indemnification. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS, Volum, ITS LICENSORS, ITS AGENTS, ITS PARTNERS, AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING Volum, COLLECTIVELY THE “Volum PARTIES”), FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, OBLIGATIONS, ACTIONS, LOSSES, LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND COSTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES INCURRED BY SUCH PARTIES, IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF (A) YOUR VIOLATION OR BREACH OF ANY TERM OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR ANY APPLICABLE LAW, RULE OR REGULATION, WHETHER OR NOT REFERENCED HEREIN, OR (B) YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY, OR © YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ANY OF THE SERVICES, OR (D) YOUR CONTENT OR OTHER COMMUNICATION DISPLAYED OR TRANSMITTED BY MEANS OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ANY OF THE SERVICES, OR (E) ANY OTHER PARTY’S ACCESS AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND/OR CONTENT WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER OR USERNAME, OR (F) ANY TAXES RELATED TO YOUR PURCHASE AND/OR USE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES (OTHER THAN TAXES BASED ON THE INCOME OF Volum). If you downloaded the Software from the Apple App Store, you acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the Software or Services or your possession and use of the Software or Services infringes any third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Volum and Apple, Volum, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim. Volum reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Volum, and you agree to cooperate with Volum’s defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Volum.

27. No Warranties.

The Software and Services are provided to you “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” with no warranties. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Volum Parties hereby disclaim all warranties, terms, and conditions, express or implied, either in fact or by operation of law, statutory or otherwise, including, without limitation, warranties, terms or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, satisfactory quality, correspondence with description, title, non-infringement, and accuracy of information generated. You further acknowledge that the Volum Parties (and if you downloaded the Software from the Apple App Store, Apple) have no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance or support services with respect to the Software and/or Services.

THE Volum PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR THE CONTENT DISPLAYED OR TRANSMITTED ON OR THROUGH ANY OF THE SERVICES, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, UP-TO-DATE, COMPLETE OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED. THE Volum PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF, OR THE RESULTS FROM THE USE OF, THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.

28. Harm to Your Device. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU TRANSMIT, DISPLAY, STORE, VIEW OR RECEIVE CONTENT THROUGH THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT RESULTS FROM THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA OR DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE AND COMPUTER SYSTEM).

29. Limitations of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE Volum PARTIES BE LIABLE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY NATURE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES FOR LOST REVENUE OR PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS OR DEVICE OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTIONARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ANY OF THE SERVICES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE PERFORMANCE, SUSPENSION, TERMINATION OR BREACH HEREOF, EVEN IF Volum OR ANY OTHER Volum PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE Volum PARTIES EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO Volum FOR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PURCHASED FROM Volum ON ANY OF THE SERVICES DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING ANY CLAIM. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. As some jurisdictions do not allow some of the exclusions or limitations set forth above, some of these exclusions or limitations may not apply to you. In such event the liability of the Volum Parties will be limited to the maximum extent possible under applicable law. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU BY REASON OF ANY PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE, SERVICES OR CONTENT SOLD OR PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES AND RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON ANY OF THE SERVICES.

30. Claims. YOU AND Volum AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. If you downloaded the Software from the Apple App Store, you further acknowledge that Apple has no responsibility for addressing any claims relating to the Software or Services or your possession and/or use of the Software or Services, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Software or Services fail to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

31. Basis of the Bargain. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT Volum HAS OFFERED ITS SOFTWARE AND SERVICES AND SET ITS PRICES IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND Volum, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND Volum. Volum WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

32. Feedback. You acknowledge and agree that any comments, suggestions, or feedback relating to the Software or any of the Services (“Feedback“) submitted to Volum are gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction, and shall become the property of Volum. Volum will have exclusive ownership of all rights to the Feedback. Volum will be entitled to use the Feedback for any commercial or other purpose whatsoever, without any compensation to you or any other person. Volum will not be required to treat any Feedback as confidential. You agree that you do not acquire any right in or to the Software or any of the Services (or any changes, modifications or corrections thereto) by virtue of any Feedback. You acknowledge that you are responsible for whatever material is submitted by you, including its legality, reliability, appropriateness, originality, and copyright.

33. Export. The Software and Services may only be operated, exported or re-exported in compliance with all applicable laws and export regulations of the United States and the country in which you obtained them. The Software and Services are specifically subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations; diversion contrary to United States law is prohibited. You may not export, directly or indirectly, the Software, Services or technical data licensed hereunder or the direct product thereof to any country, individual or entity for which the United States Government or any agency thereof, at the time of export, requires an export license or other government approval, without first obtaining such license or approval.

34. U.S. Government Rights. All Software, the Services and technical data are commercial in nature and developed solely at private expense. The software program and documentation are deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation”, respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212(b), as applicable. Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the software program and/or documentation by the U.S. Government or any of its agencies shall be governed solely by the Terms and Conditions and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the Terms and Conditions. Any technical data provided that is not covered by the above provisions is deemed to be “technical data-commercial items” pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7015(a). Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of such technical data shall be governed by the terms of DFAR Section 227.7015(b).

35. General

35.1 International Users. The Software and Services are hosted in the United States and by using the Software and/or any of the Services, if you are located in the European Union, Asia or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from United States laws, then you understand and consent to the processing of personal information in the United States.

35.2 Notices. Volum may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms and Conditions, by email, via the Services or postings on the Volum website. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four (24) hours after email is sent. Notice posted on the Volum website or via the Services is deemed given ten (10) days following the initial posting. Volum reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users.

35.3 Amendments. Volum reserves the right to amend any of the Terms and Conditions at any time by publishing the revised Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Copyright Terms, Broadcaster Agreement and/or Third Party License on the Volum website or by otherwise providing notice of such amendment pursuant to the notice provisions above. The revised Terms and Conditions shall become effective following the applicable notice period, unless you expressly accept the revised Terms and Conditions earlier by clicking on the accept button. Your express acceptance or continued use of the Software or Services after the applicable notice period shall constitute your acceptance to be bound by the revised Terms and Conditions.

35.4 Ability to Contract. You hereby affirm that you are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations and warranties set forth in the Terms and Conditions, and to abide by and comply with the Terms and Conditions.

35.5 Entire Agreement. The Terms and Conditions (consisting of the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Copyright Terms, Broadcaster Agreement and Third Party License) represent the complete agreement between you and Volum and may only be amended as set forth under Amendments above or as otherwise expressly provided therein. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and shall not affect the enforceability or validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.

35.6. Assignment. You are not allowed to assign any of the Terms and Conditions or any rights or obligations thereunder. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation thereof shall be null and void. Volum is allowed at its sole discretion to assign or transfer any of the Terms and Conditions and any rights thereunder to any third party, without giving of notice.

35.7 Waiver. The failure of any Volum Party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms and Conditions will be effective only if in writing and signed by Volum.

35.8 Headings. The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of the Terms and Conditions, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

35.9 Governing Law and Disputes. The Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents, and by the laws of the United States. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) is hereby excluded in its entirety from application to the Terms and Conditions. You agree that the Services shall be deemed solely based in California and each a passive Service that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Volum, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the State of California. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to any of the Terms and Conditions, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of any of the Terms and Conditions to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS), and the arbitration shall be conducted with a single arbitrator. Furthermore, you agree that neither you nor Volum will join any claim with the claim of any other person or entity in arbitration; that no claim will be resolved on a class-wide basis; and that neither you nor Volum will assert any claim in a representative capacity on behalf of anyone else. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that Volum shall be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. If you file an arbitration complaint against Volum, Volum agrees to pay for any portion of the initial filing fee that exceeds $250; after the initial filing fees, the parties will share the costs of arbitration equally. You agree not to commence or prosecute any action against any Volum Party other than by filing an arbitration complaint in accordance with this paragraph. IMPORTANTLY, BY AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT YOU HAVE TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND ANY RIGHT YOU HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

35.10 Injunctive Relief. You acknowledge that the obligations made hereunder to Volum are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Volum and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that Volum shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.

35.11 Third Party Beneficiaries and Agreements. If you downloaded the Software from the Apple App Store, you acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of the Terms and Conditions, and that, upon your acceptance of the Terms and Conditions, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms and Conditions against you as a third party beneficiary hereof. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Software and Services is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement, including those of any Application Store, as may be applicable, when using the Software and/or Services.

35.12 No Partnership, Agency, Joint Venture. The Terms and Conditions do not create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture.

35.18 Severability. If any of the provisions of the Terms and Conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Information We Collect

When you access or use the Service or third party games that were developed using a Volum SDK pursuant to a separate agreement between Volum and the game developer (“Third Party Games”) from or through your smart phone, tablet, computer or other device (each, a “device”), or when you install the Service on your device and register with Volum, personally identifiable information about you may be collected. This collection may occur at different times, and for different purposes as explained below.

Download and Registration When you download an application that is part of the Service you are requested to register with us. For registration through Volum, you are only required to provide your mobile phone number or your email address, depending on the device(s) you are using on the Service. You may also provide other personally identifiable information, but that is optional. When you log in using your Facebook account, we collect additional information you make available to us (see “Your User Profile”) below.

Address Book

If you are not already a user of the Service, when you first install an application that is part of the Service on your device, you are invited to register with Volum and as part of this initial registration, you will be asked to allow us access to your address book. If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your address book on the devices you use for the Service (names, numbers, emails, and Facebook ID, but not notes or other personally identifiable information) and we will store it on our servers and use it to improve the Service and help you use the Service. If you do not want Volum to store this information, you may opt-out at any time through your account settings in the Volum mobile app, or in your device’s privacy settings, in which case we will delete that information from our servers. However, in this case, we may not be able to offer some of the features that require this information. See also “How We Use the Information We Collect” below.

Location Information

We may request access to your current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies – so that we can provide content that is more suitable to your location. For example, we may use information about the location of your device for certain calling features or share information about the location of your device with advertisers to tailor the advertising you see to your interests or present you with offers from the businesses around you. You are free to accept or block access to your location information. You can switch off access to your location at any time through your device settings.

This mobile app may collect and pass to third parties precise geolocation information linked to your mobile device or advertising identifiers and may do when you use the app or when the app runs in the background on your device. That information may be used by third parties to customize ads in this app or in other apps: for instance, if your device is often located at or near music venues, you might receive offers for music tickets (even when you are not at a music venue). The information also may be used for market or other research regarding aggregated traffic patterns: for instance, a company that analyzes shopping trends might use the information to learn whether more or fewer devices are seen near malls or in other shopping districts.

We automatically collect usage information that does not identify an individual user (“Usage Data”). For example, when you download and use the Services on a mobile device, we automatically collect information such as your device type, operating system version and type, certain device settings, device time zone, device carrier, current IP address, applications installed on the device, and platform-specific advertising identifiers. We may also collect location information, such as your device GPS coordinates unless you configure your device operating system settings to prevent our collection of location information. Additionally, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. We use this information to enhance the services we offer, provide targeted advertising, and to help us understand how people use the Site and Services.

Aggregated device data, including location and usage data, is also measured for the purposes of market research by Placed, Inc. For further information, please see the Placed Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you do not want this information to be linked to your device, you may go to your device “settings” (which are somewhat different for iOS and Android devices) and opt out of interest-based or personalized advertising. You may also prevent the location from being collected by this or other apps, through your device settings (but this may affect the functionality of certain app features).

Profile Information

We collect and store certain profile information including your name, phone number, email address, picture, country of residence and preferences.

Usage Information

We may collect and store information about your usage of, and interaction with, the Service and Third Party Games (whether or not played on the Service), including calls, messages, posts, information relating to games played (such as games played, your game scores, how often you play and how much money you spend on the games), usage of the Service by geographies, device and connection information (such as a device advertising identifier or MAC address), IP address, device capability, bandwidth, web browser software, referring website, statistics on page views, network type and traffic to and from our websites.

Advertisements

When we serve an advertisement to your device, we collect information about your interaction with this advertisement to help us evaluate the performance of the advertisement that we show, such as whether you clicked on it, or installed the advertised product. The third parties that serve these advertisements may also collect other information about your interaction with an advertisement and about your browser or device. This collection and the subsequent use of this information by these third parties is subject to these third parties’ privacy policies over which Volum has no control.

Shared Text, Photos, Videos and Other Communications

The Service allows you to share text messages, photos, videos and other communications (such as interactions during games) with other users, and if you choose to share your text messages, photos, videos and other communications, such items will be stored on our servers in accordance with our data retention policies. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other Service users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending text messages, photos, videos or other communications through the Service is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). Volum is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share. There is no tolerance for objectionable or abusive content, including nudity, illegal products, services, or activities, misleading, deceptive, sensational or excessively violent content, discriminatory practices, tobacco products, drugs, and drug-related products, unsafe supplements, adult content, adult products or services, surveillance equipment, hacking or cracking, work at home schemes. Promoting external links for users to purchase digital content or services outside the app is prohibited. All violators will be banned. For questions, please contact support@Volum.me.

Device and Log Information

If you use our Service, we collect information about your device and browser. This may include device information (type of device, operating system version, unique device identifier (such as an advertising identifier), browser type and version, mobile network information) or log information (IP address, MAC address, screen resolution, and referring domain).

Error Reporting Information

We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or hangs up so that we can investigate the error and improve the stability of the Service for future releases. In general these reports do not contain personally identifiable information, or only incidentally. As part of these error reports, we receive information about the type and version of your device and browser, the device identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error.

How We Use Information

In addition to using your information to provide you with the Services that you request, we use or may disclose your personally identifiable information as follows: To verify your identity; To connect you with your Volum contacts and others as enabled by the Service; To share your Profile with your Volum contacts and others on the Service in accordance with your account settings; To allow your use of certain features of the Service that may be offered from time to time (such as Premium Services (see our Terms of Use), games, greeting cards, animations, etc.) and to help customize your user experience; To show you the names and profiles of the Volum contacts with whom you communicate and to show your name and profile to persons with whom you communicate on the Service; To manage your account, deliver to you any administrative notices, updates, notifications, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Service; To provide you with relevant content that you requested, using information that you allow us to collect from you or that you provide to a social media provider with which your Volum account is connected, such as information regarding your and your Volum contacts’ respective locations; To share information about the games you play on our Service, your score or your experience, with your Volum contacts – according to your settings; To understand (i) how you use the different features of the Service, (ii) what your preferences are – for example, what type of games you like to play, what type of music you like to attach to your pictures or what type of products you like to view or purchase, and (iii) how to make suggestions and recommendations of things (for example, games, music and products) you may be interested in; To keep your list of Volum contacts up to date – for example, when new users join Volum; To solicit information from you, including through surveys; To contact you via email, SMS or otherwise for the purpose of informing you about new products, services or promotions offered by Volum (you can opt-out of such emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link, withhold your consent to receive an SMS or reply stop to an SMS in order not to receive future SMSs); For internal operations, including troubleshooting problems, data analysis, testing, research, improvements to the Service, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other illegal activity; When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities.

With Whom We Share Your Information Service Providers

In certain instances, Volum may have contracts with third parties to provide Volum with products and/or services in connection with the Service. In those cases, Volum may share your personally identifiable information with these third-party service providers, or authorize them to collect information on its behalf, but only in connection with providing the services to you or Volum. For example, these third party service providers include: Third party SMS and email providers who deliver the authentication SMS or email to you when you register with the Service and with whom Volum shares your phone number or email. Third party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, such as hosting, business analytics, customer service, collecting or processing credit and debit card information and payments, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. Third party vendors who provide outbound calling services for Volum users and with whom Volum shares your call detail records if you use that service (such as your phone number, the destination you are calling and information related to the initiation and termination of such calls).

Business Partners

We have relationships with other companies, such as game developers, where we serve as the publisher or distributor of the applications, products, or services developed by those third parties. In this case, both Volum and that third party may have access to certain information about your use of that third party’s application, product, or service. For example Volum may host a third party’s game through its Service, and would have access to some information about your use of that game (such as whether you play it or not, your game scores, how often you play and how much money you spend on the game), while the third party would have access to your score, other information about your use of that game and your Volum profile. In this case, the information that we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy and the information that the third party collects is subject to that third party’s privacy policy.

Outbound Links

If you choose to access optional services, such as a website, product or service provided by a third party, including through the Service, such third party may also collect information about you. Please see the privacy policies of each such third party for more information about how they use the information they collect. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any exchange of information between you and any third party. These third parties include business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our Service. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service that you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. Legal Process We also may share your information with third parties: In response to facially valid subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process when we have a good faith belief that the law, any legal process, law enforcement, national security or issue of public importance requires disclosure; To resolve disputes, trouble shoot problems, protect and defend our rights or property (including to enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements) or the safety of Volum, the Service, or that of our customers or others; To establish or exercise our legal rights, or as otherwise required by law; In connection with a corporate transaction involving Volum or the Service, such as the purchase or sale of a business unit, an acquisition, merger, sale of assets, corporate reorganization, liquidation, or other similar event.

Aggregate and Anonymous Information

We may also share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. Aggregate or anonymous information is information that does not, on its own, identify you personally. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of users our app receives or share anonymous identifiers (such as device advertising identifiers or hashed email addresses) with advertisers and business partners. This information does not contain any personally identifiable information.

Other

Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not share our users’ personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If in the future, we plan to share personally identifiable information with any third party for its direct advertising purposes other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified in accordance with applicable law.

Display of Tailored Advertising

We allow third parties with whom we have a separate agreement to use certain technologies to collect information about your browser or device and the placement, views, and clicks of their advertisements, so that they can better serve interest-based advertisements to our users and visitors. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Service; (2) attribution partners who help us measure effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) advertising networks, which collect information about your browser or device and your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements on the Service and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not share with these third parties any information that would personally identify you (such as email address) for purposes of such advertising; however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as an advertising identifier or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you would like to opt out of receiving tailored advertising in the Volum app, please follow the instructions available in our Support Center, here.

Do Not Track Policy

California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal and whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual’s online activities from their site or service. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, the Service does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.

Your User Profile

The information you enter into your user profile (your “Profile”) may be shared with your Volum contacts. You control your Profile and you can access and modify your Profile from the Volum application at any time. In addition, if you register with Volum using your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you give us your express consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email address, profile picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is available to other users of the Service who are connected to you on Volum. In addition, unless you opt-out (which you may do at any time in the Volum application), your Profile is discoverable by other Volum users, including by way of example in listings of contacts that will include your proximity to other users (however, Volum will not share your location with any users). You may also “block out” any Volum user in your contact list from discovering your Profile at any time.

Data Access and Removal

You can always control what information you choose to share with us on the Service. To do so, you can change your settings in the Service or in your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the Service from your mobile device entirely. You can remove your data anytime you want by clicking here and submitting a request. Your data will no longer be available to your Volum contacts. If you ask us to delete your account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers, however certain information may be retained in our back-up or archival systems. Please note that, after your account is closed, we may retain certain information associated with your account, including for analytical purposes as well as for record keeping integrity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, If you request, we will delete or anonymize your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless, we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following: If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved; (ii) Where we are required to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law; and/or, (iii) Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users. Any personally identifiable information and any content that you share in text messages, photos, videos or otherwise in or through the Service with other users, or (ii) submit on a blog, bulletin board or chat room on our website or elsewhere, can be viewed and used by others, including to send you unsolicited messages or to commit identity theft. Volum is not responsible for any use or misuse of your information that might result from your disclosure of information.

Opt-Out – Promotional Communications

Volum allows you to choose not to receive promotional email messages from the Service or its service providers. You may opt-out by following instructions in the message sent by Volum or its service providers on how to unsubscribe from that particular mailing. You may also opt-out by contacting us at privacy@Volum.me.

Security

Protecting user privacy and personally identifiable information is a top priority for Volum. We make substantial efforts to ensure the privacy and security of all personally identifiable information you provide to us. Access to all personally identifiable information is restricted to those individuals who need to know that information in order to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support or improve the Service. Volum uses password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all member information. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control or in transit against loss, misuse, or alteration.

Data Transfer

Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Volum maintains facilities, including outside of the United States. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data as described in this Privacy Policy, Volum reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. In addition, by using the Service (which is governed by California law, this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use), you consent to be governed by California law for these purposes and in connection with your use of the Service.

The Service is not directed to children under the age of seventeen (17) and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of seventeen as part of the Service. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of seventeen as part of the Service, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of seventeen as part of the Service.
